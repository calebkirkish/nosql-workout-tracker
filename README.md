# Description
   Using mongoDB and the mongoose for simple database modeling the schema. We use express to handle all of the routes to the different pages and requests that we need to call.

# Installation
- express
- mongoose
- morgan
# Usage
   As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
